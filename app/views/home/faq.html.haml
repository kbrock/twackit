%h3 What is it you do here?
%p
  We look for special Twitter statuses, or tweets, that are some kind of 
  metric or value that you&#8217;d like to track.  
  By graphing that data over time, we can help you keep a record, spot trends, 
  meet goals&hellip; 
  
%h3 What kind of data can I twack?
%p
  Just about anything you can stick a number to. Your 
  weight, expenses, time spent exercising or working, your car&#8217;s mileage&hellip;

%h3 How do I twack something?
%p
  Using your favorite Twitter client, send a message to 
  %strong @twackit 
  with a value and at least one hashtag. You can include a note to give your 
  twack some additional human-friendly context if you&#8217;d like.
%blockquote.tweet
  @twackit 185 #weight packed some on over the holidays

%h3 Is my information safe?
%p
  It&#8217;s the internet, so&hellip; no, not really. Just don&#8217;t tweet 
  or twack anything that you aren&#8217;t comfortable sharing
  with the rest of the world.

%h3 I have a really awesome idea for a feature!
%p
  That&#8217;s technically not a 
  %em question,
  but find the blue feedback button to get to our 
  == #{link_to_function 'UserVoice forum', "UserVoice.Popin.show()"}
  and let us know what&#8217;s on your mind.

%h3 I don&#8217;t have a Twitter account. Can I still, um, twack it?
%p
  Sorry, no. Go

  and join the twackiness!
